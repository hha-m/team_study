### 1. common cloud characteristics as defined by the NIST
NIST: National Institute for Standards and Technology<br>
❶On-demand self-service<br>
➋Broad network access<br>
❸Resource pooling<br>
❹Rapid elasticity<br>
❺Measured service<br>

### 2. cloud technologies
❶Software as a service(SaaS)
- applications are accessible from client's devices(web, mobile, etc)
- customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure

➋Platform as a service(PaaS)
- privides cloud infrastructure to customer
- permits the customer to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications developed for the cloud
- The provider ensures the required programming languages, libraries, services, and tools are available for the customer(pay-per-use or charge-per-use)
- customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure, including the network, servers, operating systems, and storage
- but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment
- containing both a physical layer(server, storage, and network components) and an abstraction layer(software deployed across the physical layer)

❸Infrastructure as a service(IaaS)
- allows the customer to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources
- permits the customer to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications
- but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment
- customer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure
- but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications. The customer might also have limited control of select networking components such as host firewalls

### 3. deployment models of cloud technologies
❶Private cloud<br>
<b>use</b>: a single organization comprising multiple consumers<br>
<b>manage</b>: organization, a third party, or some combination of both<br>
➋Community cloud<br>
<b>use</b>: a specific community of consumers from organizations<br>
<b>manage</b>: one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of both<br>
❸Public cloud<br>
<b>use</b>: open use by the general public<br>
<b>manage</b>: a business, academic institution, or government organization, or some combination of the three)<br>
❹Hybrid cloud: private, community, or public
