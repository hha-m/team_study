# What is IAM?

- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service that helps you securely control access to AWS resources. You use IAM to control who is authenticated (signed in) and authorized (has permissions) to use resources. 


- When you first create an AWS account, you begin with a single sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user 

- strongly recommend that you do not use the root user for your everyday tasks, even the administrative ones.
- ***First-time access only: Your root user credentials ***

You can work with AWS Identity and Access Management in any of the following ways. 
    1. AWS Management Console 
    2. AWS Command Line Tools 
    3. AWS SDKs 
    4. IAM HTTPS API
